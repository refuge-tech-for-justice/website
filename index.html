        <p>
            CentRefuge provides a technical solution to the current refugee crisis. Unlike many other platforms, CentRefuge 
            allows refugees to communicate their basic needs and also invites volunteers to respond to those in need. Our project 
            is threefold: a SMS system, an Android application, and a web applcation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The SMS system allows refugees to request food, water, or shelter through texts. By texting +1-(256)-515-4199, they can
            easily convey their needs to the public. The SMS system will collect all the requests, and...
        </p>
        <p>
            The Android application retrieves the requests from our databases and notifies nearby users if someone is in need.
        </p>
        <p>
            The web application populates and visualizes the requests from the refugees. Authorities can use the site to determine 
            locations where reponse is needed.
